# UFO Analysis
Using JavaScript and Bootstrap

## Overview of Project
The webpage and synamic table of initial study are working as intended.  The customer (Dana) would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.  The filter criteria would include date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results
HTML and JavaScript was used to create table filters that filter on date, city, state, country and shape. This image is of the date being entered as 1/1/2010 and the webpage was updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".  It helps to include the state when searching a city.

## Summary
The webpage is limited by the data entered.  There could be more sightings for the same period of data.  One suggestion would be to do a search for more data.  The webpage could also have a follow up of the sighting as to what the authorities explained the sightings to be.
